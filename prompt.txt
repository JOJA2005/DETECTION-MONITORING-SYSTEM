Create a full-stack AI-powered Smart Office Monitoring System using Flask

The system must use computer vision (cv2) to automatically detect and recognize employee faces through a live camera feed and monitor their entry, exit, and basic actions in real time.

CORE FEATURES:

1. Face Detection and Recognition:
- Use OpenCV-based face detection.
- Implement a reliable face recognition method such as LBPH or a pretrained face recognition model.
- Allow registration of new employees by capturing multiple face images.
- Train the model and store facial data locally.

2. Live Camera Monitoring:
- Continuously capture video from a webcam.
- Detect faces in real time.
- When a known face appears, display:
  "<Employee Name> has entered the office"
  or
  "<Employee Name> has exited the office"

3. Entry and Exit Logic:
- Automatically determine entry vs exit using timestamps and last-seen status.
- Prevent duplicate attendance within short intervals.
- Maintain accurate time tracking.

4. Action Detection (Basic):
- Detect simple actions such as:
  - Sitting
  - Standing
  - Walking
  - Idle
- Use pose estimation or lightweight action recognition.
- Store detected actions with timestamps.

5. Database:
- Use SQLite for simplicity.
- Create structured tables:

Employees:
- id
- name
- department
- face_data_path

Attendance:
- id
- employee_id
- entry_time
- exit_time
- action
- date

6. Web Dashboard:
Build a clean html dashboard that includes:

Admin Features:
- Add / remove employees
- Upload face data
- Retrain model button

Monitoring Panel:
- Live attendance table
- Current employees inside office
- Activity history

Reports:
- Daily attendance
- Employee work duration
- Search and filter
- Export to CSV

7. Architecture:
Separate the system into modules:

- vision_module → handles camera, detection, recognition
- action_module → detects posture/actions
- database_module → manages SQLite operations
- web_dashboard → frontend
- training_module → trains face recognition model

Ensure the camera system updates the database in real time so the dashboard reflects changes instantly.

8. UI Requirements:
- Minimal
- Professional
- Dark or neutral theme
- Easy navigation
- Table-based monitoring

9. Performance:
- Optimize for real-time detection.
- Avoid heavy models that slow down webcam processing.
- Ensure the system runs smoothly on a standard laptop.

10. Security (Basic):
- Admin login required.
- Protect employee data.

GOAL:
The final system should look like an industry-level smart office solution rather than a basic student project.

Provide:
- Folder structure
- Dependencies
- Installation steps
- Modular code
- Comments for readability
- Scalability suggestions
